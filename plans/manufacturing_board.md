To recreate this layout using React components, here's a detailed description that you can use as a prompt for an LLM or a guide for manual implementation:

### Prompt:
Create a Flutter component that displays a Work Order (WO) tracking board with three columns: **"Di Jadwalkan" (Scheduled)**, **"Dalam Proses" (In Process)**, and **"Selesai/Ditutup" (Completed/Closed)**. Each column contains multiple cards representing individual work orders with detailed information. Here's how each section should be structured:

#### **Layout Structure:**
1. **Container**:
    - A responsive container with three columns, each representing the status of the work order (Scheduled, In Process, Completed).
    - Each column has a header indicating its status.

2. **Card Structure**:
    - Each card displays information related to a specific Work Order (WO).
    - **Card Header**:
        - A unique Work Order number (e.g., "WO.2024.08.00001").
        - Start date (e.g., "Tgl Mulai 02/08/2024").
        - Estimated completion date (e.g., "Est. Selesai 09/08/2024"), highlighted in red if overdue.
    - **Card Body**:
        - Lists the tasks and their completion statuses.
        - Each task includes:
            - Task name with an icon.
            - Quantity and completion percentage (e.g., "Cake Coklat Bakar (1 PCS) 1000 (100%)").
            - Timestamp (for certain items) displayed in red if overdue.
        - Expandable sections for additional task details (using a dropdown).
        - A status label (e.g., "Selesai" with completion date in green).
    - **Card Footer**:
        - A "Lihat Detail" (View Details) button that allows users to access more information about the work order.

#### **Styling and Appearance**:
- Use modern, clean UI elements with a mix of rounded corners and shadows for the cards.
- The "Scheduled" column uses a blue theme, "In Process" uses an orange theme, and "Completed" uses a green theme.
- Each card uses color indicators to differentiate between completed, in-progress, and overdue tasks.

#### **Functional Requirements**:
- Cards are interactive, with dropdown sections to reveal additional information.
- Use reusable React components for cards, tasks, and status labels.
- Ensure the layout is responsive, with cards stacking vertically on smaller screens.

This prompt can guide an LLM to generate the necessary code to create a similar UI using React and Tailwind CSS or other styling libraries. Let me know if you need the actual React code!
